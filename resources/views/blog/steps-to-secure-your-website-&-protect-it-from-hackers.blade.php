          <p class="dark-color font-400">In the era of cyber crimes and so many frauds happening over the internet, it is necessary to protect your site from various hackers who will want to take over your website. You must follow some essential steps that will ensure that your website is safe from ransomware like malicious viruses. Here are the steps that you can follow to protect your website:</p>
          <h3>Monitor your pages regularly:</h3>
          <h6>Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks can install malicious JavaScript on your pages, run it in your users' browsers, and modify page content or steal information to get back to attackers. For example, if you show a comment on a page without verification, the attacker can send comments via script tags and JavaScript, which works on every other user's browser and steals their login cookie, allowing the attacker to control all the user's account. You need to make sure that users do not include JavaScript active content in your pages.<br>This is a particular problem in modern web applications, where pages are built primarily from user content and in many cases produce HTML, followed by earlier frameworks such as Angular and Ember. These frameworks offer many XSS protection options, but server mixing and customer service also create new and sophisticated attack modes: you can not only install JavaScript in HTML, but you can also encode content by encoding angular commands or using Ember helpers.</h6>
          <h3>The software must be updated:</h3>
          <h6>This may seem obvious, but it is important that you keep all the software up to date to keep your site safe. This applies to the server operating system and any software on your website, such as CMS or the platform. Once the website's security holes are discovered in the software, hackers quickly exploit it. When using a managed hosting solution, you do not have to worry about running the operating system security updates, as the hosting company has to take care of you.</h6>
          <h3>Proper Authentication:</h3>
          <h6>Authentication should always be performed on the browser and server-side. Mandatory roles where the browser is empty and you can catch common failures when entering text in numeric numbers only. However, you can bypass this and make sure you look at this authentication and a valid server authentication, failure to do so may result in malicious code or encryption code being added to the database or causing unwanted results to your website.<br>As is mentioned above, repairing a corrupt website is very difficult and time-consuming. A backup copy of your website allows you to restore it to normal. After that, you can take the time to fix the hack and close any website vulnerabilities that allow the hacker to log in. Your host may provide backup, but it is not recommend relying solely on hosted backups. The reason is that in most cases, these backup copies don't work or you have to go through a long process of restoring your site. So do follow the procedures and protect your website from hackers.</h6>
