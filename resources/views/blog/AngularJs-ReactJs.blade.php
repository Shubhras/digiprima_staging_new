           <h3 class="play-font  font-700">Comprehensive :</h3>
           <h6>AngularJs is a comprehensive solution for rapid front-end development. It does not need any other plugins or frameworks. Moreover, there are a range of other features that include Restful actions, data building, dependency injection, enterprise-level testing, etc. </h6>
           <h3 class="play-font  font-700">Unit Testing Ready :</h3>

           <h6>If there are more than 2000 watchers, it can get the UI to severely lag. This means that the possible complexity of Angular Forms is limited. This includes big data grids and lists.</h6>
