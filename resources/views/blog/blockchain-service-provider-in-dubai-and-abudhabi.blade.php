          <p class="dark-color font-400">Initially, when transferring the money from your account to another account, the banks keep an entry on the register of transactions updated on both, receiver and sender’s account. But there is one problem, the Entries of transactions can be manipulated easily or changed. Thus, People who know how the banking system works are trying to avoid them because of this problem. This is where Blockchain comes to play.<br>A blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, public ledger. In simple words, blockchain is a block of digital pieces of information. The words “block” and “chain” in this context, means talking about digital information (the “block”) stored in a public database (the “chain”). They have three parts:<ol><li> Blocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar amount of your most recent purchase.</li><li> Blocks store information about people participating in the transactions.</li><li>3: Blocks also store information that distinguishes them from other blocks.</p>
          <h3>How Does Blockchain Work?</h3>
          <h6>A node will start a transaction by first creating and then digitally signing it with its private key. The private key is created via cryptography This transaction is propagated by using a flooding protocol known as Gossip protocol. This validates the transaction based on preset criteria. To verify the transaction more than one node is required.
            Once the transaction is validated and verified, it is included in a block, which is then propagated onto the network again.Now the newly-created block becomes part of the ledger, and the next block links itself cryptographically back to this block. This link is a hash pointer with transaction’s second confirmation and blocks first confirmationTransactions are then validated and verified every time a new block is created. A total of six confirmations is required in a network to consider the transaction final.</h6>
          <h3>How is Blockchain changing the world?</h3>
           <h3>Smart contracts:</h3>
          <h6>Smart contracts are computer programs that are collected in a blockchain. They can be utilized to automate the unstoppable shift of crypto-tokens within users, according to agreed-upon conditions. Smart contracts require steady access to real-world data and issues.</h6>
          <h3>Advertising:</h3>
          <h6>The technology has gained rapid growth that even these possible applications of blockchain in terms of online advertisement would have been unimaginable a few years ago. We are still in the initial days of a digital advertising revolution whereas the future blockchain is aiming toward is one we’ll all need to live in.</h6>
          <h3>Medical:</h3>
          <h6>Firstly, an individual decentralized blockchain database can be reached by accredited people whether healthcare providers, patients, or insurance carriers at anyplace, at any time, and in a form that all people can work with.Secondly, blockchain technology permits for security measures that are unavailable through other digital sharing techniques.Finally, blockchain technology diminishes the number of intermediaries which decreases the possibility for error, while concurrently fulfilling a high level of transparency and security.Thus, Blockchain is changing the world in various fields. The Transactions will be grouped in blocks, recorded in a chain of blocks and the link is protected by cryptography, and so previous transactions cannot be destroyed or changed.</h6>
