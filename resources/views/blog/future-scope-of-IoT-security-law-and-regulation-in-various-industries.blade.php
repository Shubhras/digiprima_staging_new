          <h4 class="mt-0 font-700 ">IoT security law and regulation- what it means for the future of interconnected devices.</h4>
          <p class="font-20px">Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the popular technologies in the era of digital transformation. Though many industries have been benefited the most after the introduction of the Internet of Things, there are still security challenges for the future of the internet of things (IoT).  The number of IoT devices is rapidly increasing over the last few years. According to recent research, there will be more than 26 billion connected devices around the world by 2020.<br>Though IoT devices bring effective communication between devices, automate things, save time and cost and have numerous benefits, there is one thing still concerning the users is the security of IoT. Let us take a look at IoT security law and regulation and the future scope of IoT security.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-0 font-700 ">IoT Security Laws to Protect Consumers from Hacks of Internet-Connected Devices</h3>
          <p class="dark-color font-400">As the number of Internet-connected devices continues to proliferate at an exponential rate, governments in both the UK and the United States are working for consumer protections included on all devices. In January 2020, California was the first state to pass an Internet of Things (IoT) security law. Consumers and governments never thought about security protections built into Internet-connected devices and how security could lead to real-world problems until they witnessed the Mirai attack in 2006.<br>
            Only after Mirai attack where hackers were able to compromise Internet-connected devices all over the world into a massive botnet capable of taking down the world’s most popular websites via a spectacular denial of service attack.<br>
          In Britain, the UK government introduced a new draft law that will require certain cyber security features to be built into IoT products for consumer’s protection. Both of these IoT security laws could surely encourage other nations looking to improve the security of so-called “smart” devices hooked up to the Internet.</p>

          <h3 class="mt-0 font-700 ">Pros of IoT laws</h3>
          <p class="font-20px">California law is a good first step in making sure that consumer IoT devices are safe and secure. Plus, Critics say that the new IoT cyber security law has aimed to set default passwords to enhance security whereas some have pointed out, some authentication steps are not the password.<br>
          The U.S. is not the only nation to take action, the British government has also been taking steps to improve the security of connected devices. They should ensure that the devices must meet the following minimum requirements including unique default passwords, state the length of time security updates will be made available. Also, offer contact at the vendor for disclosure of the product’s cyber security vulnerabilities.</p>
            <h3 class="mt-0 font-700 ">Final Thoughts: Future of interconnected devices</h3>
          <p class="font-20px">Security appears to be given less thought as the market has grown. Lawmakers now have planned to make sense of the IoT security mess and ensure manufacturers convey the security of their products in a more effective way to avoid any damage. If the security protections of Internet-Connected Devices is implemented successfully, then the future of the Internet of Things will be bright in solving consumer’s security issues. </p>
