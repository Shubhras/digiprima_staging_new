          <p class="dark-color font-400">In a mobile-first world, Shubhra believes that service providers should be able to help businesses translate new technologies into interactive mobile app development solutions that assist in enhancing the audience base. When asked about the preference regarding platform and technologies, the CEO shared that most of their solutions are in PHP, Laravel, and Mean Stack (MongoDB, Node.js, Express JS Framework, Angularjs).
            It was also interesting to learn from her that when it comes to backend development, it takes about 40% of the total development timeframe, whereas frontend development takes up the remaining 60%. Features, which are mostly covered in the scope of work, budget, and requirements like security, encryption, and compliance, are the major parameters that are considered by their engineers before selecting the right platform.
            DigiPrima offers custom website designs that are responsive to all major operating systems and mobile devices. Based on the project needs and requirements, Shubra shared that the preferred CMS are WordPress and Drupal. Apart from custom development, the firm also provides website maintenance services. It was also refreshing to learn that the firm takes in any project without a minimum budget, given that it appeases while also challenges the intellect of their development team.Their zeal to excel in every project they undertake and their undeterred determination is what will soon earn them a place in the coveted list of top app development companies at GoodFirms.</p>
