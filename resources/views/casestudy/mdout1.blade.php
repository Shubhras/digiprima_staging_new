        <h2 class="heading">Project Initiation</h2>

              <p >We started with first understanding USER NEEDS. Our assigned BA and PM conducted comprehensive online workshops to fully grasp the end user needs. During these workshops we did our own independent research, analyzed all available data and spoke with a select few end users. The information we gathered from these quantifiable entities enabled us to not only understand the overall needs of the project, but also the core needs and pain-points of the and users. At the conclusion of this exercise, we delivered</p>

              <p >Keeping with Agile methodology, we started this undertaking by aligning 2 separate yet equally important teams to work in tanderm.The first team along with our UI/UX specialists started with working on visual  representation of the project. Detailed and functioning wireframes were delivered to showcase our suggested layouts and application flow. Our focus was on delivering an innovative, user friendly and simple design layout.The second core development team along with our PM worked on finalizing the overall application architecture with focus on ensuring app is secure, stable and scalable. We looked at real world behavior to learn/analyses how existing services are used. We let data drive our decision making when it comes to preparing app architecture

             <p>Every exercise, we conducted until this stage allowed us to prepare a comprehensive developmental road map which enabled us to be not only cost effective, but also extremely productive, agile and ensuring ON TIME deliveries.During this stage, the PM maintained various dashboards in real-time. We also provided daily, weekly and monthly Progress Report. A staging environment was maintained, where the client was able to see the progress as it happens. Requirement traceability matrix, forward and reverse traceability matrix were established and tracked to ensure scope, deliverables and product build is progressing in desirable direction.<br>We conducted a complete review in-house before releasing any built. Our team of testers and QA Analyst did a complete study and conducted a plethora of manual and automated testing on each deliverable before releasing it for:</p>

      <h2 class="heading">Communication Plan</h2>
      <p>In order ensure a complete synergy and flawless execution of the undertaking, we put a lot on emphasis on developing a complete, detailed and comprehensive “Communication Management Plan” during the initial planning phase of the project. This plan helped us define the general communication requirements for the project and included:</p>

                <li> The plan’s purpose and approach.</li>

  <h2 class="heading">Execution Plan</h2>
              <p>CUnderstanding the elements of a project execution plan provided clarity to the role of the stakeholders and heleds in overcoming project challenges. For us, the Project Execution Plan (PEP) is the primary document that defines how the project will be undertaken. It details the specific activities in the project, the resources applied to the project, and the organization of the project. The core elements of a project execution plan for this undertaking consisted of:</p>
              <ul class="ulistreact">
                <li><b>Scope Definition: </b> Scope definition entails defining what the project intends to achieve in specific terms.</li>
                <li><b> Statement of Goals: </b>The statement of goals lists out specific project requirements such as key project deliverables, milestones, and the project life cycle. </li>
                <li><b> Quality and Technical Specifications: </b> While the project scope and statement of goals make clear the output of the project, one important element that needs inclusion in the project execution plan is quality or technical specifications of the work processes and output. The achievement of such stipulated standards determine the successful execution of the project. </li>
                <li><b>  Allocation of Resources:</b>  The elements of scope, goals, and quality define in clear terms what the project hopes to achieve. The next element of a project execution plan that we take into consideration is the allocation of resources to achieve the stated goals and quality standards. Resources include staff with knowledge or skill sets, monetary constraints, and time consideration.</li>
                <li><b>  Project Scheduling:</b>  Project scheduling by far is the most critical and important element in a PEP. We utilize Gantt Charts that list what will happen and when. This allows us not not only break the project into various deliverables, but also allows us resource allocation scheduling more effectively. Attached Image #5 will help illustrate this better.</li>
