<h2>Project Initiation</h2>
<p>We started with first understanding USER NEEDS. Our assigned BA and PM
conducted comprehensive online workshops to fully grasp the end user needs.
During these workshops we did our own independent research, analyzed all
available data and spoke with a select few end users. The information we
gathered from these quantifiable entities enabled us to not only understand the
overall needs of the project, but also the core needs and pain-points of the and
users. At the conclusion of this exercise, we delivered:</p>

<ul class="unordered-list">
  <li><h3>User stories and Epics</h3></li>
<li><h3>Detailed Scope of work</h3></li>
<li><h3>Resource Allocation Breakdown</h3></li>
<li><h3>Detailed Communication plan.</h3></li>

       <h2>Development planning</h2>

       <p>Keeping with Agile methodology, we started this undertaking by aligning 2
separate yet equally important teams to work in tanderm.
The first team along with our UI/UX specialists started with working on visual
representation of the project. Detailed and functioning wireframes were delivered
to</p>

<p>showcase our suggested layouts and application flow. Our focus was on
delivering an innovative, user friendly and simple design layout.</p>

<p>The second core development team along with our PM worked on finalizing the
overall application architecture with focus on ensuring app is secure, stable and
scalable. We looked at real world behavior to learn/analyses how existing services
are used. We let data drive our decision making when it comes to preparing app
architecture.</p>

      <h2>Product Development and Testing</h2>
       
        <p>Every exercise, we conducted until this stage allowed us to prepare a
         effective, but also extremely productive, agile and ensuring ON TIME deliveries.</p>

         <p>During this stage, the PM maintained various dashboards in real-time. We also
provided daily, weekly and monthly Progress Report. A staging environment was
maintained, where the client was able to see the progress as it happens.
Requirement traceability matrix, forward and reverse traceability matrix were
established and tracked to ensure scope, deliverables and product build is
progressing in desirable direction.</p>

</p>
<p>
  We conducted a complete review in-house before releasing any built. Our team
of testers and QA Analyst did a complete study and conducted a plethora of
manual and automated testing on each deliverable before releasing it for:
</p>

<ul class="unordered-list">
  <li><h3>Initial, stand alone UAT.</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Comprehensive UAT.</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Pre Application Deployment UAT.</h3></li>
  <li><h3>Post UAT feedback.</h3></li>
