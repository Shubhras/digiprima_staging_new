                <div class="panel-body">The fixed-price contract is one of the IT outsourcing models that you can use in project-based engagements. It means that the payment does not depend on how much time and resources the vendor will spend to complete the project.What differentiates fixed-price contracts from the time and material outsourcing model is that the scope of work and the resources needed to complete the objective are not disclosed to the customer. The time & material model saves the time you’d spend on planning. The preparation stage is completely performed on the provider’s side which comes at a cost of transparency and awareness.</div>

In a nutshell, it is very similar to having your own remote employees. Employer’s staff have access to the communication channel with each of the team members, issue tracking system, project management tools, daily or weekly status meetings, etc. The team can be managed both onsite and offsite. </div>

                <div class="panel-body"> The Dedicated Development Center or the Offshore Development Center is basically the same dedicated team outsourcing model with some global differences. Enterprises use this model in case they don’t have an internal IT department capable of the full cycle of software development. In opposite to the dedicated team model, where external specialists are used rather as an augmentation to the in-house IT team, dedicated centers are used to outsource the whole IT processes on the service provider’s premise. The hourly rate would be extremely cost-inefficient for the customer who needs the offshore development center. The rest of the dedicated development team perks such as zero hiring cost and access to the deeper pool of the talents are also valid for the offshore development center. </div>
