<h3>What all we did?</h3>

<p>We can really relate to this project now that we’ve grown this product from where we approached it. So we did all as below –</p>
 
<br>

<ul class="new-sec-list">
  <li>Business analysis.</li>
  <li>Project Management.</li>
<li>Designing and UX planning fully. </li>
<li>Development of multiple POC (proof of concepts).</li>
<li>Analyzing and integrating all the multiple POCs</li>
<li>Quality Analysis done keeping in mind the standards of the finance industry.</li>
<li>Product was made a white label and is SaaS. </li>
<li>Now vision of this project is to make it easy and quick for manufacturers, dealers and small businesses to acquire financing for their customerProblem Statements at low rates, fair terms and be able to manage the process simply.</li>

</ul>


<h3>Problem Statement<h3>

<p>Banks are looking for borrowers to use their money, borrowers looking at banks for loan and some 3rd party vendors looking to close the gap between borrowers and lenders. But all individually which causes the classical Chinese whispers problem. </p>

<p>Our problem statement thus is bridging the gap between the loan providers, seekers and facilitators via communication, calculator and management tools.</p>

<br/>

</p>

<h3>How did we approach it?</h3>
<p>This platform was a tool that our client was looking for to bridge the gap between the loan providers, seekers and facilitators a.k.a. vendors. It was not a domain we knew much about but our skills to almost dig out solution from any problem thrown to us came into use. </p>

<p>Our client was really busy in seeking the right market for it and wanted to see us develop a quick prototype that he could use. And that’s what was our first step - loan calculator. </p>


<P>A user could just come into the system, put their amount and tenure in and get the lowest EMI possible for them with all details. That was the right start the client needed and then started building a communications model around it. So now along with the calculation, the users could speak to each other, share documents for verifications. Now was the last piece of the puzzle - can we make them enter into a loan contract? And yes we did it in a way it was seamless!</P>





<br>
<br>



<h3>Project Roadmap</h3>


<ul class="new-sec-list">
  <li>We started off by just supporting client by telling him we didn’t have this domain but had the right intent and knowledge of our industry. All we needed was a little guidance in the beginning. Chad was very supportive and made us learn his industry very nicely! </li>
  <li>Next was a POC (proof of concept), which was the tool of calculating the EMI. </li>
<li>Then we thought along with the client - why not connect the users too - leading to another PoC of communications model, which was iterative. </li>
<li>Then was the POC of managing users. And its then we realized there were too many POCs, which we needed to connect, and something we did in 2014 last 2 months. </li>
<li>2015 was a year we looked right into taking this product to the next level - allowing the vendor type users OR the loan facilitators to seek more loan seekers. And we came up with a proposals sending engine which utilized all contacts of the vendor while tracking each such campaign taken. It was worth our time.</li>
<li> We looked at controlling the white label and allowed the admin of SaaS users to make edits to their “theme” and give it a shape. We improved on our analytics and super admin features to have control of all users and accounts. </li>
<li>At this stage we are refining the product to new business standards by working on things like - auto loan suggestor tool, partner OR bank side of tasks where the banks can create various types of loans and make them available. </li>
<li>Vendors can now choose their loan program etc. too. </li>
<li>Future work is all set as we take the drivers seat now.</li>

</ul>

<!-- 
<img src="images/screen-3.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">Backlinks via SpyFu.</p>
</center>
<br/><br/>
<p>Forbes, Wired, Yahoo Finance—Warby Parker has gained links from many high-quality websites. Most of these backlinks fall into three categories:</p>






<ul class="new-sec-list">
  <li><b>Business model teardowns -</b> Where websites like Forbes and Yahoo speak to how Warby Parker revolutionized the way consumers buy their glasses. You’ll find a number of articles like “[Company Name] Wants to Be the Warby Parker of [Industry].” When people read these features, it piques their interest in Warby Parker and what makes their strategy so effective.</li>
  <li><b>Culture features -</b> Where websites like DailyBeast and  MarketWatch share Warby Parker’s one-for-one purchase model. Whenever someone buys a pair of Warby Parker glasses, the company donates a pair to someone in need. This highlights Warby Parker’s brand values and makes them more appealing to millennial buyers.</li>
<li><b>Product showcases -</b> Where websites like Uncrate and Black Lapel feature Warby Parker’s glasses directly. As an ecommerce platform, these are incredibly valuable for increasing visibility for the Warby Parker brand. And it’s a great way to increase their audience through other trusted platforms.
</li>

</ul>


<p>Gaining these high-quality backlinks, most of which have above-average domain strength, helps Warby Parker maintain their position in the SERP. And the diversity of links they receive helps them as well—a varied backlink profile is one of many positive ranking factors for Google.</p>

<p>For a company that doesn’t have a focus on content marketing, these different types of backlinks are the best chance they have for increasing visibility for both search engine crawlers and potential customers. It also helps Warby Parker support their more targeted keyword strategy.</p>

<h3>Keyword Targeting That Highlights Specific Use Cases</h3>
<p>Warby Parker ranks for 7,371 total keywords, sharing only 2,695 of them with top competitors. These keywords are specific to the products they sell, as well as the way potential customers can purchase them. Targeting use cases helps Warby Parker stay top-of-mind across every segment of their market, whether it’s the type of glasses they sell, the purchase method used, or the type of customer they want to attract.</p>

<center>
<img src="images/screen-4.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">Organic keyword data via SpyFu.</p>
</center>
<br/><br/>
<p>Many of Warby Parker’s most valuable keywords are highly competitive as well.</p>

<center>
<img src="images/screen-5.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">Most valuable keywords sorted by Ranking Difficulty via SpyFu.
</p>
</center>
<br/><br/>

<p>This level of difficulty makes sense when you review the types of keywords Warby Parker shares with their competitors. Each one in the screenshot above is some sort of semantic variation of a common customer question.</p>


<p class="mt-heading-two">How do I buy glasses online?</p>

<p>Considering how important this question is for Warby Parker, it’s no surprise that they rank well. The search intent is as close to a perfect match as you can get between customer need and product value.</p>

<p>Warby Parker’s business model was significantly different from the traditional experience of buying glasses. So they needed to get their brand name in front of as many potential customers as possible to create their market. Going after the high-difficulty keywords was one part of the strategy; the other was product- and use-case-specific keywords.</p>

<br/><br/>
<center>
<img src="images/screen-6.png" alt=""/>

</center>
<br/><br/>
<center>
<img src="images/screen-7.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">Product-specific organic keywords via SpyFu.</p>
</center>


<p>Warby Parker ranks well for all types of eyewear for men, women, and children. And they rank for variations on frame, prescription, and sunglasses. Each keyword gets its own product URL as well:

</p>
<ul class="new-sec-list">
  <li>https://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses/women</li>
  <li>https://www.warbyparker.com/eyeglasses/men</li>
  <li>https://www.warbyparker.com/sunglasses/women</li>
  <li>https://www.warbyparker.com/sunglasses/men</li>


</ul>
<br/><br/>

<p>This URL structure helps Warby Parker direct potential customers to the most valuable pages based on their search. It’s a commonly used ecommerce strategy, but one that definitely pays off when you consider the customer experience.</p>

<p>Combine this with their paid advertising strategy, and it’s not hard to see how they’ve built such a successful online brand.</p>

<h3>Paid Performance to Reinforce the Brand</h3>
<p>Warby Parker uses PPC and paid advertising campaigns to ensure their brand is always present in the SERP. In the early years of their company, this helped increase awareness for their novel purchase experience. Now, it gives Warby Parker the strength they need to fend off a slew of new competitors.</p>

<p>The core of this strategy is aggressive paid keyword buying—Warby Parker goes after all keywords relevant to both their brand and their products. Doing so increases visibility across a number of relevant search queries and helps Warby Parker connect with customers at any stage of their buyer’s journey.And Warby Parker does this with a relatively modest budget when you consider their size. Their competitors have to do a lot more heavy lifting just to be a part of the conversation.</p>

<h3>19,254 Paid Keywords Connect Warby Parker with Their Audience</h3>
<p>When Warby Parker was starting out, their bold PPC strategy helped evangelize their product, their company, and their values. Now, it helps them keep their brand top-of-mind. They accomplish this by going after close to 19,254 paid keywords using the same kind of targeting as their organic campaigns.</p>
<br/><br/>

<center>
<img src="images/screen-8.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">PPC keywords over the past five years via SpyFu.</p>
</center>
<br/>


  <p>Over the past five years, Warby Parker has slowly ramped up their paid keyword buying strategy. While some months might only see 6k to 7k individual keywords, this strategy translates into an estimated 203k monthly PPC clicks.</p>

<p>These approximately 200k PPC clicks combine with their 779k organic clicks to get Warby Parker close to a million overall clicks from SEO each month. That’s an insane amount of potential traffic they have the opportunity to convert, with each click directing a search to a targeted product or landing page.</p>

<p>Warby Parker mirrors their organic keyword strategy by going after product name variations and relevant long-tail key phrases in their ads as well.</p>
<br/>
<br/>

<center>
<img src="images/screen-9.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">PPC keywords via SpyFu.</p>
</center>
<br/>

<p>Just take a look at these paid keywords—we can see a number of specific use cases:</p>

<ul class="new-sec-list">
  <li>reading glasses</li>
  <li>buying glasses online</li>
  <li>blue light blocking computer glasses</li>
  <li>affordable eyeglasses</li>
  <li>measuring pupil distance</li>
</ul>
<br/><br/>

<p>This means that Warby Parker not only attracts potential customers looking for reading glasses, or glasses to use when spending long periods of time on the computer—measure pd is a keyword for helping potential customers find the right-sized frames at home.</p>

<p>Each of these is a specific use case or customer persona that Warby Parker knows would benefit from their product or platform. All they need to do is communicate that value effectively in their ads.</p>

<h3>Doubling Down on Ad Content That Works</h3>
<p>When we look at Warby Parker’s ad history, it tells the story of a thoughtful, data-driven team. Many of their ads show an initial period of testing and copy changes, followed by extended runs of the same or similar content. When Warby Parker finds something that converts, they stick with it.</p>
<p>Take a look at this ad history for their blue light blocking glasses:</p>
<br/><br/>


<center>
<img src="images/screen-10.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">Ad history via SpyFu.</p>
</center>
<p>Each of the dark blue-green tags represents the same ad running for several months at a time. Typically, we see about six months of value from each ad before Warby Parker chooses to switch up the content. When you’re going after such a wide array of keywords and phrases, being able to rely on ad copy that converts frees up more time for testing less new ads.</p>

<p>We see even longer periods of similar content for ads targeting readers and reading glasses.</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<center>
<img src="images/screen-11.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">Ad history via SpyFu.</p>
</center>
<br/><br/>

<p>But a more varied approach for affordable eyeglasses and best glasses online.</p>

<br/><br/>


<center>
<img src="images/screen-12.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">Ad history via SpyFu.</p>
</center>

<br/>

<p>That makes sense when you consider how competitive each keyword is. Reading glasses is a much less popular target keyword than affordable eyeglasses. With so many competitors gunning for the top position, Warby Parker has to switch up their content more often to stay relevant.</p>

<p>Their competitors even go after warby parker as a keyword, driving up the cost of branded keywords.</p>
<br/><br/>
<center>
<img src="images/screen-13.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">Example ads for “warby parker” via Google.</p>
</center>

<br/><br/>
<p>That means Warby Parker has to be really smart with their budgets to make sure they don’t overspend going after the wrong kinds of keywords.</p>

<h3>A Consistent Ad Budget That Doesn’t Break the Bank</h3>
<p>Warby Parker pays an estimated $420k a month on their PPC campaigns. That’s only slightly higher than most of their competitors, but well under <a class="mt-links" href="#">GlassesUSA.com</a>, a competitor that spends $424k.</p>

<br/></br>
<center>
<img src="images/screen-14.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">Top paid competitors via SpyFu.</p>
</center>
<p>The graph above shows Warby Parker’s budget over the past year in red. While now they’re matching their top competitor on overall budget, last year they were still under $300k per month. That indicates that GlassesUSA.com’s strategy must have driven down conversion rates for Warby Parker. We see the budget increase in January 2020 when funds are typically
 allocated.</p>

<p>If we take a look at their budget over the past five years, these increases only really started happening around 2018.</p>
<br/></br>
<center>
<img src="images/screen-15.png" alt=""/>
<p class="cap-img">Estimated monthly PPC budget over the past five years via SpyFu.</p>
</center>
<br/>
<p>Being able to maintain an even more modest budget for the first eight years of their company history is a testament to Warby Parker’s overall market dominance. As the first mover and established brand in sales of online glasses, they were able to rest on their laurels for quite some time.</p>

<p>We’re excited to see how these budgets evolve in the coming years as Warby Parker’s competitors continue to go for the top position in the market. It’s going to be a difficult fight, though, as Warby Parker has spent years building momentum for their organic and paid campaigns.</p>

<h3>Warby Parker Built an SEO Machine That Works</h3>
<p>Warby Parker uses both organic and paid SEO to solidify and hold their position in the online eyewear market they helped create. By going after the right keywords with targeted content and ads, they’ve built an SEO and PPC strategy that elevates their brand.</p>

<p>Being able to focus on product- and use-case-specific keywords ensure that no matter what the searcher wants, or the intent behind their query, Warby Parker has a page or product that’s appealing.</p>
